# Recreating my personal website.

### Goals
1.  Recreate my personal website that was formerly written in vue3 as I am trying to migrate unto using React and specifically NextJS for my future projects.
2. Showcase the technology that I am using and the workflow that I am using in more complex projects. This project is simple and the over engineered aspect of this website is to showcase the tools that I am using on my other complex projects which I am accustomed with.
3. Showcase skills and have a hub of my improvements that I am continuously in pursuit of over the years and the years to come.
